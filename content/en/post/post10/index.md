**Ingredients**

    - 150 g shortbread cookies;
    - 75 g butter;
    - 900 g Philadelphia cheese;
    - 200 g of powdered sugar;
    - 200 g of sour cream with a fat content of 20%;
    - 3 tablespoons of flour;
    - 3 eggs;
    - 1 egg yolk;
    - a pinch of vanilla.

**Cooking**

Grind cookies in a blender, add melted butter to it and mix well. Spread the mixture in an even thin layer over the bottom of a 23 cm diameter mold and tamp down. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 10 minutes. Then take it out and let the base cool.

Meanwhile, mix cheese and powdered sugar. Add sour cream and flour and mix again. Add egg, yolk and vanilla one at a time, mixing after each ingredient until smooth.

Spread the filling evenly over the base and bake for 45 minutes at 160°C.
