**Programming in science: relevance and relevance**

Programming is often mentioned in an applied context. It seems that only mobile applications, Internet systems and special effects for cinema are created with its help. But initially programming was intended to solve scientific problems. In addition, programming itself is a science, which will be useful to learn about for those who decide to link their careers with computer development.

**General information**

Scientific programming is a highly oriented programming style for scientific computing. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, and the predominance of efficiency over universality.

Scientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without scientific programmers who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.

A number of branches of science directly depend on the level of development of scientific programming. So, unmanned vehicles, “smart” management systems for urban and agricultural management, stock exchanges are waiting for their implementation; waiting for robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence that surpasses human capabilities.

**Specialization**

Scientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran; many debugged libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations are written on it, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively.

Python has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. The Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other "scientific" languages: Fortran, C++, C#.

In turn, C# allows you to program on the .NET platform, adapt the program to the common language runtime (CLR), and accelerate development within the framework of operational scientific sessions.

**The future of the programmer-scientist profession**

Programming drives science, which drives technological progress. Inventions that were considered revolutionary yesterday serve everyday needs in the 21st century: a microwave oven, a mobile phone, an 8-bit home computer. It depends on the programmer-scientist what peaks science will reach today and which of them will enter every house tomorrow.

In the hands of a programmer-scientist are the tools not only to develop the industry, but also to improve the overall quality of life. Such a specialist increases the prognostic function of humanity, helping to predict and prevent climate, financial, and humanitarian disasters.

**Where can I learn to code?**

You can learn programming anytime, anywhere. Specialized literature, face-to-face training, Internet sites - all these resources are able to provide a novice programmer with a knowledge base sufficient for independent creativity and advanced training, including in line with scientific development.

The GeekBrains portal offers users free courses for beginners in programming. Additionally, training is provided for 15 professions that are most in demand on the labor market: Python programmer, C # developer, Senior Web Developer and others. Upon completion of each course, graduates are guaranteed an internship from GeekBrains
